ItÂ is an Unsupervised Non-linear algorithm that cluster data based on similarity or similar groups. It seeks to partition the observations into a pre-specified number of clusters. Segmentation of data takes place to assign each training example to a segment called a cluster.

Density-Based Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBScan) is an Unsupervised learning Non-linear algorithm. It does use the idea of density reachability and density connectivity. The data is partitioned into groups with similar characteristics or clusters but it does not require specifying the number of those groups in advance.

Data set
For performing K-means cluster we used Wine Quality data-set
For DBScan used IRIS data-set
